# COCA
The code and datasets to run simulation for COCA. 

Analyze1.R is the codes for  running TRA-CA and COCA. There are two file paths ("td <- setwd("E:/COCA/cov")" and "sslocation <- "C:/Program_Files/SaTScan"") in the Analyze1.R code that need to be replaced by the user according to the file locations on their own computer. Analyze2.R is the multithreaded codes for running DGLM. There is one file path ("td <- setwd("E:/COCA/cov")") in the Analyze2.R code that need to be replaced by the user according to the file locations on their own computer. The simulation datasets for running simulation is too large to upload directly to GitHub, thus only providing 100 simulations for each scenario in files (cov.tar). If needed, the complete simulation datasets with 2000 simulations for each simulation scenario can be downloaded via the link below. Moreover, the complete simulation datasets can also be generated by yourself using the code and data in files (SatScanWithCovariate.tar).
