# COCA
The code and datasets to run simulation for COCA. 

The simulation datasets for running simulation is too large to upload directly to GitHub, thus only providing 100 repetitions of the simulation data for each scenario in files (The simulation datasets for running simulation.zip). If needed, the complete simulation datasets with 2000 repetitions for each simulation scenario can be downloaded via the link below. Moreover, the complete simulation datasets can also be generated by yourself using the code and data in files (The code and data for genarating the simulation datasets.zip).
